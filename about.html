                    <p>ClearPath Junk Removal started in 2015 when founder Mike Rodriguez saw his elderly neighbor struggling to clear out years of accumulated items from her garage. After helping her that weekend, Mike realized how many people in our community needed reliable, affordable junk removal services they could trust.</p>
                    <p>What began with one truck and a commitment to honest work has grown into a full-service junk removal company serving hundreds of homes and businesses across the metro area. But our core values haven't changed: treat every customer with respect, price fairly, and leave every property better than we found it.</p>
                    <p>Today, we're proud to be a locally owned, family-operated business. Our team consists of background-checked professionals who take pride in their work and genuinely care about helping our neighbors. We're not a franchise—we're your neighbors, and we're here to stay.</p>

                    <p>Junk removal isn't glamorous, but it makes a real difference in people's lives. We've helped families prepare homes for sale, supported seniors downsizing to retirement communities, cleared spaces after loss, and helped small businesses get rid of old equipment so they could grow.</p>
                    <p>Every truck we load represents someone getting their space—and often their peace of mind—back. That's why we take pride in what we do. Whether it's a single couch or a full estate cleanout, we treat every job with the same care and professionalism.</p>
                    <p>We started ClearPath because we saw a need for honest, reliable service in an industry that sometimes falls short. We wanted to build a company our community could depend on, where fair pricing and respectful service weren't optional—they were guaranteed.</p>
