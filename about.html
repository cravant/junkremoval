                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Quick Haul was founded in 2015 by local resident Mike Thompson, who saw a need for reliable, honest junk removal service in our community. What started as a one-truck operation has grown into a full-service team, but we've never lost sight of our core values: treat every customer like a neighbor, price fairly, and take care of our environment.</p>
                    
                    <p>We're not a national franchise — we're locally owned and operated, which means we live and work in the same community we serve. When you call Quick Haul, you're supporting a local business that cares about this area and the people in it.</p>
                    
                    <p>Over the years, we've helped thousands of homeowners, businesses, and contractors clear out unwanted items, and we've built our reputation on reliability, professionalism, and honest pricing. We're proud to be the junk removal company our neighbors trust.</p>
